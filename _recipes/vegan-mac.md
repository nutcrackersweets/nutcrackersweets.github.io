This is the best version yet!!!
Smokey, spicy, savory, and melty!
You really wouldn't know it's vegan!

(Same as Take 3 but with different cheezes and no extra spice cut it doesn't need it)

### For the noodles:
#### Ingredients
* 16 to 30 oz gluten-free macaroni noodles (depending on how much noodle to cheeze ratio you want...or discren as you will when pouring the sauce and save some for later as needed) plus water and salt to boil.

#### Directions
1. Cook noodles till al dente.

### For the cheeze sauce:
#### Ingredients
* 1 cup raw cashews (soaked overnight if using a regular blender)
* 4 cups filtered water
* 1/4 cup coconut oil
* 2 tablespoons cornstarch
* 1 pack Chao tomato cayenne slices, chopped
* 1 pack Violife smoked provolone, chopped
* 1 pack Violife cheddar slices, chopped
* Follow Your Heart parmesan shreds to garnish (optional but HIGHLY recommended)

#### Directions
1. In a high-speed blender, add the cashews and water and blend until smooth and creamy (takes like a minute or two). 
  Add the chopped cheeses, coconut oil, and cornstarch.
   Start by blending on low and gradually turn up the speed, scraping down the sides and moving mix around as needed.
   (If using a smaller blender, divide the cashew milk in half and try making the sauce in two separate batches.)
2. Pour mixture into pot and heat up until cheeze has melted and sauce has formed.
3. Pour over noodles at your discretion.
   (I recommend just pouring it over individual servings as needed)
4. Garnish with parmesan or as desired (but the parmesan is BOMB).
   Red pepper flakes might be nice.

### Comments
* Extra sauce keeps well in the refrigerator but must be re-melted when needed.
* Alternately, you can pout sauce over noodles in a baking dish and bake uncovered at 375 degrees F for half an hour.
